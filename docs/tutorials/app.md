# Install the Mapforge App

### Progressive Web App

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) can be installed on devices just like other apps. Once a PWA is installed, its app icon appears on the device's home screen, dock, taskbar, or any other place where operating system native apps normally appear.
Once installed, the PWA will behave like other applications that are installed on the OS.

Most browsers support installing a PWA from their settings menu as "Add to Start Screen".
